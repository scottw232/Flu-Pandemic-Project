Pandemic Flu Spread. Consider a classroom of 21 elementary school
kids. 20 of the kids are healthy (and susceptible to 
u) on Day 1. Tommy (the
21st kid) walks in with the 
u and starts interacting with his potential victims. To
keep things simple, let's suppose that Tommy comes to school every day (whether
or not he's sick) and will be infectious for 3 days. Thus, there are 3 chances for
Tommy to infect the other kids | Days 1, 2, and 3. Suppose that the probability
that he infects any individual susceptible kid on any of the three days is p = 0:02;
and suppose that all kids and days are independent (so that you have i.i.d. Bern(p)
trials).
If a kid gets infected by Tommy, he will then become infectious for 3 days as well,
starting on the next day.
(a) What is the distribution of the number of kids that Tommy infects on Day 1?
(b) What is the expected number of kids that Tommy infects on Day 1?
(c) What is the expected number of kids that are infected by Day 2 (you can
count Tommy if you want)?
(d) Simulate the number of kids that are infected on Days 1,2,. . . . Do this many
times. What are the (estimated) expected numbers of kids that are infected
by Day i, i = 1; 2; : : :? Produce a histogram detailing how long the \epidemic"
will last.

The zip contains the files for the Flu Project Simulation. 

The Flu Project (Stats) was a program written to produce some stats for the simulation with included Macros. 
The Flu Project Simulation Spreadsheets is an excel file that contains our simulation throughout various sheets.

The Simulation spreadsheets were done in Google Sheets and has not been tested using Excel.
